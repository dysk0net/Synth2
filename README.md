# Synth2

A free, open-source recreation of **Synth1**, the classic freeware synthesizer by Daichi Laboratory ([website](https://daichilab.sakura.ne.jp/softsynth/index.html)).


Synth1 has been my go-to synth for years, as it has for many musicians, with thousands of patches on the web.
Sadly, it seems to have been abandoned in recent years. No updates, no email replies. Mac users can keep it on life support with Rosetta, but Rosetta will be gone in macOS 28 (see [this article](https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=w5ngl9k2)).

Synth2 aims to keep those sounds playable on modern computers. Open source, so that anyone can keep the project alive in the future.


- **Same parameters, same UI:** Some UX improvements (MIDI Learn, themes, etc.), but nothing was changed in the synth engine.
- **Import patches:** All Synth1 patches (`.sy1` files and zip banks) load just like in Synth1.
- **Carefully modeled with Claude:** Opus 5.5 generated ~ 3 GB of measurement data before modeling every parameter one by one.

Formats: macOS VST3 + AUv2, iPad AUv3. Windows VST3: first port (see Building). Linux ports are welcome: if you're a developer on Linux, fork the repository and open a pull request.

## Download

Official builds are published on the Oxo Music website:

- macOS 14+ (VST3 + AU, signed and notarized): <https://oxo-music.com/products/oxo_synth2>
- iPad (AUv3): App Store (link coming)

## Relationship to Synth1

Synth2 is an independent recreation of Synth1 by Daichi Laboratory. It is
**not affiliated with or endorsed by** Daichi Laboratory. No Synth1 code,
binaries or artwork are used. The sound was matched only by measuring the
original plugin's audio output (clean-room; see `tools/s1ref`).

I emailed Daichi in January 2025 and October 2026 to propose
open-sourcing or supporting Synth1, and even offered to raise funds for their
time, but got no reply.

Synth1 is a trademark/work of its respective owner. Patches (`.sy1`) are
loaded for compatibility only; no Synth1 banks are distributed.

> Dear Daichi, if you're reading this: I hope you're well. I'm not trying to take over your project; I'd just love to keep Synth1 patches playable for future generations. Please [contact me](https://oxo-music.com/support/): if you'd rather this project didn't exist, I'll take it down. Above all, I would love to see YOUR original code released under an open-source license. I'd be happy to maintain it if you're open to it.

## Building

Requirements: a Mac with a recent Xcode (developed with Xcode 27).

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chab/oxo_synth2.git
cd oxo_synth2
# (already cloned without --recursive: git submodule update --init --recursive)
```

A local build keeps the official identity: it replaces an installed Oxo Synth2
(same IDs). That's fine for development; to distribute builds, see
[Forks](#forks).

### macOS (VST3 + AUv2)

Also needs CMake 3.25+.

```sh
./build_vst3.sh   # builds and installs the VST3 + AUv2 into ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins
```

### iPad (AUv3)

Open and build `OxoSynth2.xcodeproj` in Xcode. To run it on a device, Xcode
must sign it with **your** Apple developer team (`Identity.xcconfig` holds the
official one). Don't edit that file: create `Identity.local.xcconfig` next to
it with one line:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <your Team ID>
```

Your Team ID is shown at developer.apple.com > Account > Membership details.
The file is gitignored, so it stays on your machine.


### Windows (VST3)

Requirements: Windows 10+ x64, Visual Studio 2022 or newer (C++ workload), CMake 3.25+, Git.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chab/oxo_synth2.git
cd oxo_synth2
cmake -S OxoSynth2VST3 -B build -A x64 -DSMTG_CREATE_PLUGIN_LINK=OFF
cmake --build build --config Release
```

The result is the bundle `build\VST3\Release\OxoSynth2.vst3` (the SDK's validator runs on it
as a post-build step). Copy that folder to `C:\Program Files\Common Files\VST3`. zlib is taken
from the system if CMake finds it, else fetched from GitHub.

Per-user files: settings in `%APPDATA%\Oxo Music\Oxo Synth2`, the bank library in
`Documents\Oxo Music\Oxo Synth2`; the factory bank sits inside the bundle. Deleted banks go to
the Recycle Bin.

The Windows editor (`OxoSynth2VST3/source/win`, VSTGUI) has all 99 parameters + volume, the
patch LCD with previous / next, a bank browser, and a menu (initialize, load / save `.sy1`, all
notes off). Not ported yet: MIDI learn, themes, UI scaling, the write dialog, bank import /
export / delete from the browser, the controller-routing menus (params 86-89 still work from
patches). `-DOXO_WIN_EDITOR=OFF` builds without it (the host shows its generic editor).

CI: `.github/workflows/windows-vst3.yml` builds and uploads the bundle.


### Tests

```sh
make -C EngineCoreTests test
```

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `EngineCore/` | The synth engine: portable, header-only C++20 (parameters, `.sy1` codec, voices, filters, effects, patch library) |
| `EditorCore/` | Editor services shared by the VST3 and the AUv3 (C bridge to the UI, state, per-user files) |
| `Shared/` | The SwiftUI panel (mac and iPad) |
| `OxoSynth2VST3/` | VST3 plugin (+ the SDK's AUv2 wrapper), CMake |
| `OxoSynth2.xcodeproj`, `OxoSynth2/`, `OxoSynth2AudioUnit/` | iPad app (an "open it in a host" screen) + AUv3 extension |
| `EngineCoreTests/` | Engine unit tests |
| `tools/s1ref/` | Black-box harness for the original Synth1 + the measurement / fitting scripts |
| `tools/s2render/` | Renders the same test jobs through Synth2, for comparison |
| `reference/meta/` | The measurements the engine tables are generated from |
| `third_party/` | Steinberg VST3 SDK, Apple AudioUnitSDK (git submodules) |

`AGENTS.md` is the project's catch-up file for contributors and AI coding
agents: rules, architecture, build / test commands, and the measured facts
about the original and how they were measured.

## Reference data (for engine work)

The engine's tables come from measurements of the original plugin
(`tools/s1ref`, see its README). The results are committed in
`reference/meta/`; `EngineCore/MeasuredTables.hpp` and `LegacyTables.hpp` are
generated from them.

The renders of the original Synth1 (4,270 files, 3.4 GB unpacked) are not in
the repository:

1. Download [synth2-reference.zip](https://oxo-music.com/downloads/synth2-reference.zip) (1.4 GB).
2. Unzip it at the repository root:

   ```sh
   cd oxo_synth2
   unzip ~/Downloads/synth2-reference.zip
   ```

   This adds `reference/renders/` and `reference/derived/` (both gitignored)
   next to `reference/meta/`.

What's inside:

- `reference/renders/manifest_<group>.jsonl`: one line per render, a complete
  job (all 99 parameter values, notes, length, sample rate) plus the WAV it
  produced in the original (`file`, 44.1 kHz float).
- Groups: `sweeps` (every parameter over its range), `pitch`, `filter`,
  `velocity`, and `presets` (416 real-world patches, anonymized as
  `patch0001`…).
- `reference/derived/`: measurement caches (filter / EQ transfer functions)
  used by the fitting scripts.

To compare Synth2 against the original (needs Python 3 with numpy):

```sh
make -C tools/s2render
cd tools/s1ref && python3 compare.py presets   # or sweeps, pitch, filter, velocity
```

A port to another platform can use the same data: render each manifest job
with the new engine and compare it to the WAV.

Regenerating the renders needs the original Synth1 AU, an Intel-only binary
that runs only on macOS versions that still ship Rosetta. Once Rosetta is gone,
this archive is the only way to compare against the original.

Contributors: the clean-room rule applies. Study the original only through
its audio output and its published plugin interface. Never disassemble or
decompile it, and never copy its artwork.

## Forks

You are welcome to fork and redistribute (MIT). If you work with an AI coding
agent, point it to `AGENTS.md` first: it is written for agents to catch up
with the project (rules, architecture, commands, measured facts), and most
agents read it automatically. Keep it up to date as you go.

If you ship your own builds, give them **their own identity** so they can be
installed next to the official ones without host conflicts. Every identity lives in
`Identity.xcconfig` (or override it in `Identity.local.xcconfig`); the Xcode
project, CMake, `build_vst3.sh` and the mac installer all read it:

| Key | Used for |
|---|---|
| `OXO_PRODUCT_NAME` | Display name, bundle names (`<name>.component`, `<name without spaces>.vst3`), installer |
| `OXO_VENDOR` | VST3 vendor |
| `OXO_VENDOR_WEBSITE`, `OXO_VENDOR_EMAIL` | VST3 info, update dialog contact (host only, no `https://`) |
| `OXO_UPDATE_PRODUCT` | "Check for updates" slug on your website; **leave empty** to remove the menu entry |
| `OXO_BUNDLE_ID` | Mac `.vst3` / `.audiounit`, iPad app (as is) and extension (`.AudioUnit`), installer package IDs |
| `OXO_APP_GROUP` | iPad app group (bank library shared by the app and the extension) |
| `OXO_AU_MANUFACTURER`, `OXO_AU_SUBTYPE` | Audio Unit 4-char codes (all-lowercase manufacturer codes are reserved by Apple) |
| `OXO_AU_NAME` | Audio Unit name (`Vendor: Product`) |
| `OXO_VST3_PROCESSOR_UID`, `OXO_VST3_CONTROLLER_UID` | VST3 class IDs: generate fresh ones (`uuidgen`) |
| `OXO_DATA_FOLDER`, `OXO_LIBRARY_FOLDER` | Mac per-user folders (`~/Library/Application Support/…`, `~/Music/…`) |
| `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` | Your Apple signing team (in `Identity.local.xcconfig`) |

Outside that file, replace the app icons:
`OxoSynth2/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset` and
`OxoSynth2AudioUnit/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`.

Internal names (`OxoSynth2` targets and files, `Oxo…` message IDs) are not
visible to users and need no renaming. Keep the state tag `'OXS2'` and the
`.sy1` format as they are, so projects and patches stay compatible.
