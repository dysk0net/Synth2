# Synth2 (Oxo Synth2) — catch-up notes

What a new contributor or AI coding agent must know to work on this repo:
rules, architecture contracts, build / test commands, and the MEASURED facts
about the original Synth1 (do not rediscover them). History lives in git;
keep this file current, not chronological.

## Rules

- CLEAN ROOM: the original Synth1 is studied ONLY through its audio output
  and its published AU interface (`tools/s1ref`). Never disassemble /
  decompile the binary, never copy its artwork (e.g. its panel bitmap
  `s1_07.png`).
- PATCHES: no third-party preset FILES in the repo or the products
  (`reference/presets/` is gitignored, local only). Bundling a
  third-party bank needs the designer's explicit permission (sites listing
  banks, e.g. rekkerd.org, do not license them). Patch / bank NAMES are fine
  where they carry technical info, not as decoration (mocks, screenshots:
  neutral names). `EngineCoreTests/legacy_fixture.txt` (values of real
  legacy patches, no names) is technical test data.
- `README.md`'s "Relationship to Synth1" section is agreed text: keep it.
- `Shared/` must stay iOS-clean (mac-only code under `#if os(macOS)`). Fast
  check: `xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator swiftc -typecheck -target
  arm64-apple-ios17.0-simulator -import-objc-header EditorCore/OxoSynth2Bridge.h
  Shared/*.swift` (the snapshot tool needs the same `-import-objc-header`).
- `third_party/` submodules are never edited: SDK fixes are string patches
  on GENERATED copies in `OxoSynth2VST3/CMakeLists.txt` (FATAL_ERROR if the
  anchor moves).
- Commit at every significant step; messages = subject + body, no AI
  attribution trailers. Filter build / test output, never dump full logs.

## What this is

A faithful recreation of **Synth1** (Daichi Laboratory, freeware, modelled
on the Clavia Nord Lead 2; abandoned, its mac AU is x86_64-only and dies
with Rosetta). Same 99 parameters (same indices), loads `.sy1` patches and
zip banks, SOUNDS THE SAME (tuned against renders of the original). GUI =
Synth1's layout, redrawn. MIT, free. Formats: mac VST3 + the SDK's AUv2
wrapper, iPad AUv3 (App Store). Windows / Linux: welcome as ports.
Stack: Steinberg VST3 SDK + header-only C++ engine + SwiftUI editor (no
JUCE). Official builds ("Oxo Synth2", oxo-music.com / App Store) come from
tagged commits of this repo.

## Identity

ONE SOURCE: `Identity.xcconfig` (repo root; forks change it, see README
"Forks"). Gitignored `Identity.local.xcconfig` overrides any key (signing
team, fork test). Xcode = project base configuration (targets use
`$(OXO_BUNDLE_ID)`, Info.plists / entitlements `$(OXO_*)`, Swift reads
`OxoAppGroup` from Info.plist). CMake parses it (`KEY = value` lines, no
trailing comments, `//` cuts values → no URL schemes) → generated
`OxoSynth2Identity.h` (VST3 FUIDs, names, folders) + configured
`au-info.plist`; `build_vst3.sh` and the installer read it too. Code-visible
strings go through `EditorCore/Identity.h` (generated header on the mac
VST3, sandbox fallback elsewhere). NOT identity (never change, compatibility):
state tag `'OXS2'`, `.sy1`, the `com.oxo.music.synth1-patch` imported UTI.
Dev tools (au_harness, ui_snapshot/auhost) hardcode OXS2.

Official values: product `Oxo Synth2`; VST3 `OxoSynth2.vst3`
(`com.oxo.music.oxosynth2.vst3`); AUv2 `Oxo Synth2.component`
(`com.oxo.music.oxosynth2.audiounit`), `aumu` `OXS2` `OXOM`, name "Oxo: Oxo
Synth2"; iPad (iOS 17, iPad only) app `com.oxo.music.oxosynth2`, appex
`com.oxo.music.oxosynth2.AudioUnit`, same AU codes, app group
`group.com.oxo.music.oxosynth2`. The panel title reads "Synth2".
Per-user settings: mac `~/Library/Application Support/Oxo Music/Oxo Synth2`
(`midi_mappings.json`, `themes.json`, `settings.json`), iPad the appex's
container. Bank library: mac `~/Music/Oxo Music/Oxo Synth2`, iPad `<app
group>/Synth2`.
VERSION: MARKETING_VERSION / CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION in `Identity.xcconfig`
+ the two plists' AudioComponents integer `version` (by hand, 65536 = 1.0).

## Layout

- `EngineCore/` header-only `oxo::s2`: `Params.hpp` (the 99 params, native
  ranges / defaults = the original's init patch), `Sy1Codec.hpp` (+ legacy
  conversion), `Synth.hpp` / `Voice.hpp` / `Filter.hpp` / `Envelope.hpp` /
  `Lfo.hpp` / `Effects.hpp` / `WaveTables.hpp` (engine), `MeasuredTables.hpp`
  + `LegacyTables.hpp` (GENERATED from `reference/meta`), `InitPatch.hpp`,
  `ParamFormat.hpp` (value labels; `DisplayName` = LCD name, effect knobs
  per effect type), `MidiLearn.hpp` (learn table, CC scaling, JSON),
  `PatchLibrary.hpp` (banks, zip reader, import, `PatchManager`),
  `TextEncoding.hpp` (legacy names: Shift-JIS / Windows-1252 → UTF-8),
  `Jobs.hpp` (s1ref job format → our engine, WAV writer).
- `EditorCore/` portable editor services: `OxoSynth2Bridge.h` (C hooks
  between C++ and the Swift editor), `SynthEditorCore.hpp` (base of the
  VST3 controller and the AUv3 instance), `State.hpp` (state chunk),
  `Storage.hpp` (per-user files, mac library / factory paths), `Trash.hpp`.
- `EngineCoreTests/` — `make -C EngineCoreTests test`.
- `OxoSynth2VST3/` — processor / controller / entry / editor view, CMake
  (SDK + AUv2 wrapper with the hidden-param auwrapper.mm patch, Swift
  static lib `OxoSynth2Editor`, links zlib).
- `Shared/` — SwiftUI editor used by both formats: `SynthModel.swift`
  (`SynthHost` protocol + model polling the host at 30 Hz; MIDI learn
  state, LCD readout, wheel gestures, browser keys), `HooksSynthHost.swift`
  (the C hooks as a `SynthHost`), `SynthControls.swift` (widgets: KnobView,
  ToggleButton (LED), CycleButton, Badge, LedRadio, WaveRadio / WaveCycle,
  ValueDisplay, MenuDisplay, SectionBox, `.learnable` hotspots),
  `SynthPanelView.swift` (the panel on a 770x560 canvas, absolute `.place`
  / `.position` layout, BottomBar = LCD + write / menu),
  `SynthLibraryViews.swift` (browser, write dialog, iPad file actions),
  `SynthLibrary.swift` (iPad library / factory paths), `SynthTheme.swift`
  (themes, ThemeDialog, LogoMenu), `SynthWheel.swift` (wheel monitor,
  `WheelFeel`), `SynthTooltip.swift`, `SynthUpdateCheck.swift`,
  `Resources/` (bundled banks, see Patch library).
- `OxoSynth2.xcodeproj` (synchronized folders): `OxoSynth2/` = iPad app,
  ONLY a screen saying "open it in a host" + version, compiles only its
  own folder: no engine, no library (the plugin's browser manages it; an
  app-side import confused users), no app group, no "Open in" document
  types; it keeps the imported `.sy1` UTI declaration +
  `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` NO. App and appex each carry a
  `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` (appex: UserDefaults CA92.1 — declare any new
  required-reason API there). `OxoSynth2AudioUnit/` = AUv3
  appex (`AudioUnit/OxoSynth2AudioUnit.swift` AUAudioUnit shell,
  `AudioUnitViewController.swift` factory + UI, `DSP/Synth2Instance.hpp`
  engine + mailboxes + learn + SynthEditorCore, `DSP/Synth2Bridge.{h,mm}`
  C API incl. the render loop) + `Shared/`.
- `tools/au_harness/main.mm` — mac check of the AUv3 C bridge (command in
  the file): render, MIDI 1 + 2 (UMP), learn, state, library hooks.
- `tools/ui_snapshot/` — `main.swift` renders the panel with a mock host to
  PNG (modes: logo, update, …); `auhost.swift` opens the INSTALLED AUv2
  in-process and snapshots the real editor. Build commands in the files.
- `tools/app_icon/render.swift` — draws the app icon (command in the file).
- `tools/prepare_app_store_screenshots.sh` — raw iPad captures dropped in
  `tools/app_store_screenshots/` (gitignored) → the two App Store sizes +
  the website's `gallery_N.jpg`.
- `tools/unify2sy1.py <file|folder>... -o <dir>` — extracts Synth1 patches
  from Unify presets (JUCE "VC2!" XML → base64 `stateInformation` → the
  "Synth1 VST Chunk Data" blob, same word layout as the AU chunk); name =
  layer title, version and raw values kept (converted / clamped on load).
  One bank per library, `NNN_<preset>.sy1`, > 128 patches split "<bank>
  (1)", "(2)".
- `tools/s1ref/` — black-box harness for the ORIGINAL + measurement / fit
  scripts (its README: chunk layout, param mapping, process-wide state).
- `tools/s2render/` — renders the same jobs through our engine.
- `tools/prepare_mac_installer`, `tools/mac_installer/` — pkg / dmg.
- `reference/meta/` — committed measurements (params.json, nativemap.txt,
  the tables' sources). `reference/renders/` + `reference/derived/`
  (download, README "Reference data") and `reference/presets/` are
  gitignored.
- `docs/images/` — README pictures (`synth2_preview.png` = a copy of the
  site's gallery_2).
- `third_party/` — submodules `vst3sdk` v3.8.1_build_84 (MIT) +
  `AudioUnitSDK` 1.4.0 (Apache 2.0); remaining patches: hidden-param
  auwrapper + AudioUnitSDK deployment target.

## Windows port

`OxoSynth2VST3/CMakeLists.txt` is platform-split: Apple = Swift editor + AUv2,
else plain C++. Windows: `EditorCore/Storage.hpp` (%APPDATA%, Documents, factory
bank found with GetModuleHandleEx), `Trash.hpp` (Recycle Bin, built from
`OxoSynth2TrashWin.cpp`), editor = VSTGUI panel in `OxoSynth2VST3/source/win/`
(`OxoSynth2WinEditor`, controls bind straight to `SynthEditorCore`; sections
are a table + shelf packing). Needs MSVC for VSTGUI's win32 layer (MinGW can
compile our sources but not link VSTGUI). CI: `.github/workflows/windows-vst3.yml`.
Known gaps: see README "Windows (VST3)"; `.string()` path conversions in
`PatchLibrary.hpp` use the ANSI code page (non-ASCII user names are untested).

## Builds and tests

- `./build_vst3.sh` → builds and installs `OxoSynth2.vst3` + `Oxo
  Synth2.component` into ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins. `--no-install` = build
  only. Validator 47/47 (`OxoSynth2VST3/build/bin/Release/validator
  <bundle>`; run it with `HOME=$(mktemp -d)` to keep your library out of
  it), `auval -v aumu OXS2 OXOM`.
- iPad: `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
  xcodebuild -project OxoSynth2.xcodeproj -scheme OxoSynth2AudioUnit
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
  build` (0 warnings in our code; `CLANG_WARN_COMMA = NO` — the engine's
  compact comma style). Then `tools/au_harness`.
- `make -C EngineCoreTests test`, `make -C tools/s2render`, CPU bench
  `clang++ -std=c++20 -O2 tools/bench/main.cpp -o build/bench && ./build/bench`
  (16 voices, one core: LP12 x80, LP24 x70, LPDL x34, detune+sub x22, all
  fx x60 realtime), `make -C tools/s1ref` (x86_64, needs the original AU).
- Python: `.venv` (numpy, scipy) for `tools/s1ref` scripts.
- MAC INSTALLER: `tools/prepare_mac_installer [--skip-build]
  [--skip-notarize]` → `dist/mac/OxoSynth2-<ver>-<build>-macOS.{pkg,dmg}`
  (gitignored). Components `auv2` + `vst3` (pkg ids
  `<OXO_BUNDLE_ID>.{auv2,vst3}.pkg`), macOS 14+, universal, bundles NOT
  RELOCATABLE, the AU's nested plugin.vst3 staged as a real copy (in the
  build tree it is a symlink). Never touches home folders (runs as root).
  Templates `tools/mac_installer/distribution.xml` +
  `resources/{welcome,conclusion}.html` (`__PRODUCT__` etc.). Signing env
  `OXO_SIGN_ID_APP` / `OXO_SIGN_ID_INSTALLER` / `OXO_NOTARY_PROFILE`;
  notarization is the default. Under a sandbox `pkgbuild` prints `write:
  Permission denied` lines but succeeds. While testing the pkg, remove the
  ~/Library dev copies (same UIDs twice).
- UPDATE CHECK (mac): menu > "Check for updates…" fetches
  `https://<OXO_VENDOR_WEBSITE>/releases.json` (`{ products: { <slug>: {
  page, mac: { version, build, url }, win: … } } }`), looks up
  `OXO_UPDATE_PRODUCT` (empty = no menu entry: forks, iPad, tools) +
  `mac`, compares with CFBundleShortVersionString / CFBundleVersion: newer
  = higher BUILD only (the version is only shown), absent entry = latest.
  In-panel `UpdateDialog`. Releasing an official mac build = bump
  `oxo_synth2: mac:` in the oxo-music.com site's `config/releases.yml`.

## Parameters and state

- IDs 0..98 = Synth1 index = `.sy1` line index = original AU param ID.
  Values are NATIVE integers (`.sy1` values). VST3 normalization uses the
  SDK's discrete convention (`FromNormalized`).
- 99 = master VOLUME (Synth1's "vol" left of the LCD, `kVolumeParamId`):
  host param (automatable) but NOT a patch param: never in a .sy1, patch
  loads leave it, the state chunk keeps it. 0..127, MEASURED law (Synth1
  chunk word 651, 64 = unity, 32 = -6.9 dB, 127 = +10.9 dB, 0 = silence) =
  `tables::kVolumeGain`. Job line `w <word> <value>` = raw chunk word. Not
  learnable.
- 94 = polyphony (1..32). 86–89 = MIDI ctrl routing (hidden, -1..65535
  like the original AU, -1 = none: src = status<<8|cc e.g. 0xB001, 0xE000
  bend; assign = param index; the menu offers Synth1's 51 targets in its
  order). Naming quirk: params 50 / 51 are called speed / amount sens in
  Params.hpp but 50 drives assign1 (default lfo1 DEPTH); keys kept for
  saved MIDI-learn maps.
- Hidden proxies: pitch bend 1000, channel pressure 1001, CC n = 1100 + n
  (IMidiMapping). Hidden read-only OUTPUT params: 1300 = MIDI learn "last
  CC" token; 1301..1304 = voice activity for the panel's 2x16 grid (8
  voices x 2 bits each, `Synth::VoiceStates`: 0 idle, 1 releasing, 2 held;
  sent on change; AUv3: atomic after each render, hook `voiceStates`).
- STATE CHUNK (`EditorCore/State.hpp` `PluginState`; AUv3 fullState key
  "OXS2" = same bytes): `'OXS2'` + u32 version 4 + u32 master volume + i32
  program slot + u32 len + bank folder (relative to the library root) +
  u32 len + theme (the instance's palette, JSON hex map, opaque to C++, ""
  = never set) + `.sy1` text. v1 / v2 restore at volume 64, no program;
  v1..v3 no theme.
- STARTUP PROGRAM (Synth1: program 001 of bankfolder0): a fresh instance
  plays the first patch of the first bank holding one (`FirstProgram`,
  scans only up to that bank; the factory bank comes first; VST3 processor
  + controller and the AUv3 instance each compute it; session state
  overrides). The program location (`SynthEditorCore::Program()`, hook
  `loadedProgram`, VST3 message "OxoProgram") drives the LCD / browser
  selection, survives editor reopen and sessions; Init / a patch file
  clear it.
- LEGACY `.sy1` CONVERSION (MEASURED, `Sy1Codec.hpp` ConvertLegacy +
  `tools/s1ref/sy1.py` convert_legacy): the original converts on load by
  EXACT version: no ver line = 100, 100, 105 / 106, 107 / 108; any other
  ver (incl. 101..104, 109+) is untouched. Tables `reference/meta/legacy.json`
  (`measure_legacy.py`: chunk version word 140) → `gen_legacy.py` →
  `LegacyTables.hpp`. 100 / 105 / 106: decay / release times, filter amount
  (unipolar → bipolar), delay level → d/w, chorus time / rate / feedback;
  100 also attack, sustain, gain, velocity, LFO speed, osc2 fine; params
  the version lacked are FORCED, routing 86..89 → init wheel routing.
  Specials: wheel sens 50 / 51 = 64 + floor(s·(127−b)·63/127²), b = RAW
  lfo1 depth 44 / speed 43; unison voices 93 = 2 poly / 4 mono (38 ≠ 0),
  detune 75 = 48 / 70 (100–106) or a per-mode table (107 / 108). Arp beat
  33 / delay time 35 are NOT converted.
  OUT-OF-RANGE VALUES (`measure_out_of_range.py`): both loaders keep them,
  the original PLAYS each as the nearest in-range value (bit-identical:
  osc2 pitch, filter type 5 / 6, filter amount 128, arp type 0 / 5, arp oct
  4, arp beat 19..64, delay 20..40 = 19, lfo dest 0 = dest 1 (not off),
  chorus type 0 / 5, mod env dest 3 / 4, unison pitch 49..85; booleans 2 /
  3 = on) → plain `ClampValue` in ParseSy1.
  Check: `check_legacy.py [--fixture] [bank folders]` (legacy patches +
  random ones of each version vs the original, 0 mismatches) →
  `EngineCoreTests/legacy_fixture.txt`.

## Patch library (`EngineCore/PatchLibrary.hpp`, tests PatchLibraryTests.cpp)

- ONE library folder we own, no references to outside folders, no zip
  banks read in place. First run creates the root + an empty "User" bank.
- Bank = 128 SLOTS; slot n = file `NNN.sy1` (Synth1 naming; a leading
  number 1..128 counts: "012_Lead.sy1"), other names fill the free slots in
  name order. Every folder with .sy1 files (or empty) is a bank,
  sub-folders are banks "parent / sub" (a folder holding only folders =
  container); loose .sy1 in the root = bank named after the root. Hidden
  names are skipped.
- FACTORY BANK: `Shared/Resources/Synth2 Factory/*.sy1` → mac VST3 bundle
  `Contents/Resources/Synth2 Factory` (CMake resources; the AUv2 nests the
  VST3), iPad appex resources (Xcode explicit folder, excluded from the
  app). Found at run time: mac `storage::FactoryRoot()` (dladdr of our own
  binary), iPad `SynthLibrary.factoryRoot` → `Synth2Create(lib, factory)`.
  Bank "Synth2 Factory" listed FIRST, `readOnly` (Write / Move refuse; no
  delete / drag; write dialog skips it). Updated with the plugin. Program
  bank token `:factory` (`kFactoryProgramBank`), not a path. Its 001 = the
  INIT patch.
- STARTER BANKS (shipped: "Madame Eljay"): `Shared/Resources/Synth2 Starter
  Banks/<bank>/*.sy1` → bundle `Resources/Synth2 Starter Banks` (sibling
  of the factory folder; CMake loop per bank, Xcode explicit folder).
  `PatchManager::Configure(root, factory, build)` → `SeedStarterBanks`:
  ONCE PER BUILD (CFBundleVersion: VST3 `OXO_BUILD_NUMBER` from the
  generated identity header, AUv3 the appex's Info.plist via
  `Synth2Create`), recorded as `build N` in `<library>/.starter_banks`
  (an older name-list file = another build). A new build copies every
  starter bank whose name is free in the library root (hidden temp folder
  + rename, race-safe) as a normal user bank: a deleted one comes back
  with the next install / update, never within the same build. A name
  already taken (the user's bank, even empty, a file, a link) is NEVER
  written into; the final rename is `RenameNoReplace` (RENAME_EXCL: POSIX
  rename would replace an empty folder created meanwhile). Existing copies
  are never updated. Happens on plugin load (the installer never touches
  homes).
- `build_vst3.sh` empties both bundled folders before building (Xcode's
  copy phase never deletes a removed patch).
- A ZIP FOUND IN THE LIBRARY (any depth) on a rescan (load, browser open,
  Refresh) = an import: extracted next to itself, then moved to the Trash
  (`Trash.hpp`; iOS → deleted); LCD shows (10 s) "X.zip
  imported and moved to Trash" (`TakeNotice` → hook `libraryNotice`). A zip
  without .sy1 stays, ignored.
- IMPORT (`ImportItems`, hook `importItems`, the browser's Import…):
  COPIES into the root. Folders copied
  (only .sy1), zips EXTRACTED into a folder of their name (one wrapping
  folder dropped, __MACOSX / dot files skipped, non-UTF-8 names cleaned),
  a Synth1 `zipbank/` folder merges into its parent, loose .sy1 →
  "Imported" bank's next free slots; never clobbers ("Bank 2"). No export
  (Finder). Sessions store the patch, never a bank ref.
- WRITE (Synth1): dialog = banks + 128-slot grid + name field + "New
  bank…" (the only in-app way to make one); writes `NNN.sy1` (replaces a
  differently named file that held the slot), "Overwrite NNN" when
  occupied; default target = the loaded slot if writing back into its
  bank, else the first empty slot.
- MOVE (browser drag and drop): renames every patch of the bank to its
  `NNN.sy1` in two phases (hidden temp names), an occupied target swaps.
  The browser stays on the bank it shows (so does a rescan landing; only
  opening the browser or loading a program selects the loaded bank).
- COPY (drag a patch onto a BANK row, "+" cursor = `.copy` proposal):
  `PatchManager::Copy` → byte copy into the bank's first free slot as
  `NNN.sy1` (its own bank = a duplicate); hook `copyPatch` → slot, -1 =
  full (LCD: "Bank is full (128 patches): cannot add a patch"), -2 =
  refused. The browser stays on the source bank (favorites workflow).
  Factory patches are draggable for copying only (no move / drop inside
  the factory bank, never a copy into it).
- DELETE (`PatchManager::DeleteBank`, hook `deleteBank`; patches: Swift
  `deleteSlot`): mac moves to the Trash, iPad deletes (`Trash.hpp` returns
  false on iOS: a container Trash nobody can empty). A bank = its folder,
  except a folder that also holds sub-folders (other banks) or the root's
  own bank: only its .sy1 files. Never the factory bank, never outside the
  root; the loaded program is forgotten if its bank goes (the sound plays
  on). Bank delete asks first (in-browser `DeleteBankDialog`, Esc cancels).
- Browser header: Import… / Open library folder / Refresh / Close (mac);
  iPad: Import folder… (picker on `[.folder]` ALONE: mixed with file types
  iOS navigates into folders, no Open button) / Import files… (zip / .sy1,
  multiple) / Refresh / Close. Rescans on every open. Bank / slot menu
  (`libraryMenu`): mac right click = [Export bank…,] Show in Finder[,
  Delete / Delete bank…]; iPad long press = [Export bank…,] [Delete /
  Delete bank…] (no delete on the factory bank). Rename banks = Finder
  (mac only).
- SCAN SPEED (measured on 150 banks x 128 = 19,200 .sy1): `PatchNameCache`
  (process-wide, path + size + mtime) → only new / changed files are
  opened for their name (rescan 60 ms vs 0.5–1.5 s uncached);
  `FolderEntries` lists each folder once and keeps the listing's file type
  (no stat per is_directory). Browser open / Refresh / editor open =
  `PatchManager::StartRescan` (worker thread, joined in the destructor;
  zip expansion under a process-wide mutex) → hooks `startLibraryScan` /
  `libraryRevision` (polled at 30 Hz, adopts the finished scan) /
  `libraryScanning`. The browser opens at once: "Loading…" with no list
  yet, else the previous list + "loading…" in the header until the new one
  swaps in. A library change on the UI thread meanwhile (write, move,
  delete, import, sync rescan: `generation_`) wins, the worker's list is
  dropped. The editor never scans synchronously at open (`syncProgram`
  waits for a list); mutations still rescan synchronously (fast with the
  cache).
- EXPORT BANK (`PatchManager::ExportBank`, hook `exportBank`, FileAction
  `.exportBank(id)`): pick a target folder (mac NSOpenPanel folders only,
  iPad picker on `[.folder]`); a folder named after the bank's (" 2" when
  taken) is created there with the bank's .sy1 files, names kept (slots
  stay), sub-banks left out. Any bank, the factory one too.

## Editor (behaviour contracts)

- Plumbing: editor → C hooks (`OxoSynth2Bridge.h`) → `SynthEditorCore`
  (patch name / serial, patch files, library, `MakeHooks`; subclassed by
  the VST3 controller and the AUv3 instance); Swift side `HooksSynthHost`.
  A patch load = begin/perform/endEdit on all 99 params (host-visible)
  inside one group edit (`SynthEditorCore::GroupEdit`: one undo step in
  hosts implementing IComponentHandler2; AU hosts may still record 99
  steps, no AU equivalent) + `OxoPatchName` message (the processor keeps the name for the state
  chunk); `patchSerial` tells the UI to refresh. Before its edits a load
  calls `PatchLoading()` (VST3 message "OxoPatchLoad", AUv3 atomic; host
  setState / fullState too) → `Synth::ClearDelay`: the delay's echoes fade
  out (15 ms), the line empties (O(1) age check, no fill), its input fades
  back in, so the switch's transient never rings in a long feedback.
  Chorus untouched.
- Panel = Synth1's layout and colours (khaki panel, dark title strips,
  black knobs, green button LEDs, red radio LEDs, wave icon grids, cyan
  displays; Osc / LFO / Wheel-MIDI left, Amp / Filter / Arp middle, Effect
  / EQ / Delay / Chorus / Voice right). Knobs: vertical drag (Shift fine),
  double-click = INIT value, wheel (full range = 1440 pt, Shift 6x finer;
  displays / radios 33 pt per step; one host gesture per burst, ends after
  0.4 s idle). Type / dst / range buttons: click = next, Shift-click =
  back. ctrl src / assign = pop-up menus. Effect type = in-panel 2 x 5 grid
  (`EffectTypeMenu`); phaser level reads feedback %. First click acts in
  an unfocused window (`acceptsFirstMouse`).
- INIT = `EngineCore/InitPatch.hpp` (`kInitPatchValues`, name INIT):
  Initialize patch and the double-click value. Params.hpp defaults stay the
  ORIGINAL's init (.sy1 missing-line fallback, legacy loading, VST3
  defaults).
- Bottom LCD: line 1 "NNN:name" (click = browser) + ◀ ▶ (next / previous
  NON-EMPTY slot, rolls over banks), line 2 = bank "NN:name" or a 1.5 s
  readout ("filter freq: 64", learn / library messages). write = write
  dialog; menu = Initialize patch | Load / Save patch file… | MIDI Learn |
  Themes… | Check for updates… (mac). The version box in the title band
  opens the GitHub project (`SynthPanelView.projectURL`).
- BROWSER KEYS (mac, `SynthModel.browserKey`): arrows load at once (up /
  down = ◀ ▶, left / right = next column, nearest non-empty slot), Return /
  Enter / Esc close (write dialog: Esc only), Esc closes the logo menu.
  Routed by `Synth2HostingView`: local NSEvent monitor + own keyDown; Logic
  fallback = editor is the front window.
- MIDI LEARN: menu > MIDI Learn → every control wears a hotspot (dim =
  unlearned, bright = armed, blue + CC badge = learned); tap arms,
  double-tap clears, the next CC (any channel, 1..127) is assigned, one CC
  may drive several params; "Exit MIDI Learn" chip; never survives the
  editor. Table = PLUGIN-GLOBAL `midi_mappings.json` ({param key: cc}),
  empty by default. The controller owns + saves it and sends "OxoMidiLearn"
  (99 x int32) to the processor, which scales a learned CC onto the param
  (`ScaledValueForCC`) and reports an OUTPUT param change; every CC also
  emits the token on param 1300. The CC keeps its engine role (wheel,
  routing). AUv3: handled in the render, same law.
- THEMES: menu > Themes… = in-panel `ThemeDialog` (AUv3 can't open
  windows), dragged by its title bar, own colour editor (no system panel),
  `WheelShield` keeps wheel events off the knobs below. 13 colours
  (`ThemeColor`); the rest derives (`Theme` struct, `@Environment(\.theme)`).
  Factory themes `ThemePalette.factory` (Synth2 = default, Blue, Gray Dark,
  Gray Light, Red, Warm, Synth1), then user themes (Save / Delete). The
  palette is PER INSTANCE, stored in the host session (state chunk v4,
  hooks `themeText` / `setThemeText`, VST3 message "OxoTheme"), never in a
  .sy1; changing it also becomes the per-user default for new instances
  (`themes.json` "current"); an instance without a session theme adopts
  that default.
- LOGO MENU: click on the "Synth2" title = in-panel menu (`LogoMenu`): UI
  size 75..200 % of 700 pt (= Synth1 at its 150 %; the 770 pt canvas is
  only the drawing grid; shown only when `model.requestEditorWidth` is set
  = mac, the iPad gets themes only), themes. Resize = C callback
  passed to `OxoSynth2EditorCreate` → `plugFrame->resizeView`. Window
  aspect-locked, width in NSUserDefaults `oxo.synth2.editorWidth`.
- TOOLTIPS: only `.oxoTruncationTooltip` on cut patch / bank names in the
  browser (first 0.5 s, then instant while warm); no help tips, no
  `.help()`; hover via `onContinuousHover`.
- iPad: same panel scaled to fit, centred (HEIGHT MODE). UI WIDTH MODE
  (toggle left of the version box, `UIModeToggle`, lit arrow = the leading
  side): the width leads minus two 40 pt invisible side strips
  (`PanelScrollStrip`, 1:1 drag + flick, no rubber band; the panel itself
  never scrolls, knobs own vertical drags), the panel scrolls vertically;
  it falls back to the fit layout when that fits anyway and while the
  browser / write, Themes or Update dialog is open (scroll kept). Mode per
  instance = AU fullState key `OxoUIWidthMode` beside the chunk (no chunk
  change, the VST3 has no mode), last choice seeds new instances
  (UserDefaults `oxo.synth2.uiWidthMode`); `SynthModel.uiWidthModeStorage`
  nil = no toggle (mac). Snapshot modes `ipad` / `ipad-wide`. Hosting
  controller `safeAreaRegions = []` + `.ignoresSafeArea(.keyboard)`; every
  text field sits at the TOP of its dialog so the keyboard never hides it.
- AUv3 plumbing: the AU parameter tree (99
  params, address = index, NATIVE values) is the host truth; observer →
  `Synth2Instance::SetFromHost` (atomic + dirty bit, applied at the next
  render); UI edits → hooks → instance → AUParameter.setValue (.touch /
  .value / .release); render-time automation is sample-accurate. MIDI 1 +
  UMP (MIDI 2.0 scaled to 7 bit). Tempo from host blocks.

## Engine facts (MEASURED on the original — do not rediscover)

Measurement scripts: `tools/s1ref/measure_*.py`, `fit_*.py` → `reference/meta/*.json`
→ `tools/s1ref/gen_tables.py` → `EngineCore/MeasuredTables.hpp` (generated).
Compare: `tools/s1ref/compare.py <group> [substr]` (groups: presets, sweeps,
pitch, filter, velocity; rebuild s2render first). Any .sy1 folder:
`compare_sy1.py <folder> [--per-bank=N] [--seed=S] [--wav=DIR]` (needs the
original AU; keeps both renders for listening).

- Levels: osc full scale 1 internally; output = x * 0.2 * gain[g] * vel.
  Sine/saw/tri amplitude 0.2 at gain 64 vel 127; pulse = (saw(p)-saw(p+d))/2
  (half amplitude), d = pw/254 (127 = square); the FINAL d (after LFO /
  mod env) is clamped to [1.25/254, 1 − 1.375/254]: pw 0 = pw 1, never
  silent. NOISE (`measure_noise.py`): a 1-bit sequence s[n] = s[n-13] ^
  s[n-18] ^ s[n-19] ^ s[n-20] (from 16 zeros, 1, 0, 1, 0; `kNoiseSeed`),
  ±0.6504; per voice slot, carried across notes (frozen while idle) like
  the oscillators; a synced osc1 wrap restarts it (the timbre of synced
  noise = that bit pattern).
- Osc: per-note band-limited tables (EVERY harmonic below Nyquist, alias
  free); osc silent when its note index > 127. Fundamentals of all shapes in
  phase (saw falling +1 at phase 0, tri peak at 0.25). osc1 shapes 0 sine 1
  saw 2 pulse 3 tri; osc2 1 saw 2 pulse 3 tri 4 noise; sub 0 sine 1 tri 2 saw
  3 square, sub phase-locked to osc1, auto level w = g/(g+32). Mix
  (`measure_osc_mix.py`, m = mix/127): osc1 (1-w)(1-m), sub w(1-m), osc2
  (1-w)m, all / (1-wm) (sub off = linear crossfade).
  osc2 pitch = integer-semitone table (±60), fine/tune 1 cent/step dead zone
  62..66. kbd track off = fixed 220 Hz. Osc1 detune: main + 8 copies at
  ±1,3,5,7 × d cents, d = 20 v/127, each ×0.297 (sine 0.288).
  FM: inst f1 = f1 + beta[v]·261.63 Hz·(sr/44100)·osc2_norm (table measured
  at key 60, to ~102): the deviation is a FIXED phase step per sample
  (`measure_fm_key.py`): index halves per octave up (keys and key shift),
  grows with the sample rate. Ring: osc2 ×
  osc1_norm. Ring BUG kept on purpose (`measure_ring_detune.py`): ring +
  osc1 detune + sub on = the sub copies skip the 0.297 gain, then the osc1
  section is bounded (modelled 1.7·tanh(x/1.7), approximate; the original
  also has osc1 × sub products); no effect without detune. Sync hard: NAIVE reset of osc2 to phase 0 (same alias energy
  as the original to 0.1 dB; do not band-limit).
- The "fixed output lowpass" (bilinear one-pole, analog 22 kHz, NO
  prewarp) is NOT per voice: it is the EQ TONE stage at 64 (see EQ).
- Amp env: linear attack 0.5 ms·2^(v/8.05); decay/release exponential
  tau table (same law); sustain = curved table. Filter env = same times,
  LINEAR sustain. Velocity: dB = -15 (sens/64)(127-vel)/126.
- Cutoff knob GLIDE (`measure_cutoff_glide.py`, job line `pt <s> <id>
  <norm>` = timed AU param): a new cutoff value ramps LINEARLY over 50 ms
  whatever the step (`CutoffRamp`, snaps while silent). Other knobs: gain
  ~instant, res / pw / mix not measured cleanly yet.
- Filter: LP12/HP12/BP12 = Chamberlin SVF ×2 iterations (input held),
  f = 2 sin(pi fc/2fs), fc = 16.7·2^(c/12.624) (c ≤ 125), d = 1-r,
  in gain 1-0.7r; output AGC (T 1.427, q 0.883, att 1.2 ms, rel 0.2 s).
  LP24 = 4 bilinear one-poles + unit-delay feedback, fc table,
  k = (0.0297 res - 0.076)·comp[c], in-loop AGC (T 1.6). LPDL
  (`fit_lpdl.py`, ~0.5 dB): linear 303-style coupled ladder, feedback
  high-passed at 100 Hz, out = (y3+y4)/2, w/k/g tables per res×cutoff
  (fitted on SMALL-signal TFs: `measure_filter.py --types 4 --mix 10 --out
  filter_tf_lpdl_small.npz`, `fit_lpdl.py --in ...`), 2× oversampled
  trapezoidal. NONLINEAR (`measure_lpdl_nl.py`): input x·1.3/g → tanh;
  feedback k·f → tanh(2kf)/2 (NOT a per-stage tanh nor an AGC on k).
  Saturation AFTER filter: y = (1+a)x/(1+a|x|), a table. Order: osc →
  filter → sat → amp. Cutoff mod in knob units: kbd track table pivot key
  48; FILTER ENV (`measure_filter_env.py`) sweeps linearly from base − 2.1
  (env 0) to the env-1 TARGET clamp(base + (amt-64)·1.984·velscale, −2,
  125) (base = knob + kbd track; the TARGET is clamped, not the result: an
  amount past the top still sweeps over the whole attack / decay; amount
  linear down to 0), vel switch scale table.
- MIDI ctrl routing (`measure_wheel.py`, exact on 418 points): src word
  (0xB0nn CC, 0xE000 bend, 0xD000 pressure) ADDS round(v * d * 128 / (63 *
  127)) knob units to the assign param (live, never written to the patch),
  d = sens - 64 above 64, sens - 63 below 63, 63 / 64 = off; clamped.
  Engine keeps `base_` (patch) and `values_` (played). Init patch: CC1 ->
  lfo1 depth / speed at sens 74. Pressure 0..127 like a CC; pitch bend is
  BIPOLAR v = (bend−8192)/64. Targets whose range is not 0..127 (key shift,
  bend range, unison pitch) are NOT routed.
- PITCH MOD RESOLUTION (`measure_pitch_mod.py`): the pitch bend uses its
  7-bit MSB only (trunc((v−8192)/128), ±63 = ±range); bend + LFO pitch
  cents are summed and TRUNCATED toward 0 to 1/128-octave steps (9.375
  cents: slow vibratos and bends are staircases; `Voice::PitchMod`). Fine
  tune and the mod env's pitch are not quantized; the portamento has its
  own steps (ceil, relative to the target).
- Mono / legato: a new note retriggers in mono (new velocity), glides in
  legato; releasing it falls back to the previous held key, mono
  RETRIGGERS there (last velocity), legato does not. A mono retrigger also
  restarts the osc phases (osc phase > 0).
- EVENT TIMING: the original starts / ends notes at the start of their
  16-sample sub-block (host-block relative: up to 15 samples early); bend /
  CC are not snapped. Ours too (`NoteEventOffset`: VST3 processor, AUv3
  render loop, s2render).
- PORTAMENTO (`measure_porta.py` → `kPortaTau`): every 16 samples the
  distance r ← max(r·a − E·(1−a), 0), a = exp(−16/(tau·sr)) (tau in s, same
  at any rate), E = 1.35 % of the glide's starting distance past the
  target (lands in finite time, ~310 ms at 64 whatever the interval); played pitch = target + ceil(r / 9.375
  cents) steps (1/128 octave: slow glides end in audible steps). A voice
  glides from ITS OWN last pitch (never used: MIDI note 0, so the first
  note after loading sweeps up from far below); mono / legato always use
  voice slot 0 (unison 0..N-1, also while the last note releases); auto
  mode: mono legato notes only, never poly.
- Voice allocation: ROUND ROBIN (next idle voice after the last started).
  Stealing: the oldest RELEASED voice first, then the oldest held one
  (age = start time in samples). A stolen voice still sounding keeps its
  filter / output state and a free-running sub (resetting them clicked).
  Poly: a key pressed again while held releases its voice (stack), the
  note starts on a fresh one.
- VOICE END (`measure_noise.py`, noise position = slot sample counter):
  decay / release aim 1/2048 BELOW their target and stop on it
  (`measure_env_tail.py`: the tail falls faster than a pure exponential,
  -60 dB ~7 % earlier; a decay to sustain 0 = silent but still held), the
  release end = the env end, the voice at the first
  256-sample boundary after (host block relative, `Synth::BeginBlock(frames)`)
  or the host block's end if sooner (NOT measured, assumed; required:
  without it host blocks < 256, e.g. AUM at 64 / 128, never end a voice).
  The original then leaves a -108 dB residue for 8960 samples (not
  modelled).
- Patch changes under HELD KEYS keep the notes playing (hold a note, browse
  patches). A patch LOAD (editor / browser: `PatchLoading` → VST3
  "OxoPatchLoad", AUv3 flag) also fades the voice mix (pre effects): 25 ms
  out, the edits made meanwhile land at silence (voice filters cleared, no
  cutoff glide), hold while edits keep coming (10 ms quiet, 150 ms max),
  250 ms in (`Synth::BeginPatchChange`; host automation is not faded). Stuck-free rules (fuzz test
  `RandomPatchSwitchesUnderHeldKeysLeaveNoStuckNote`): the mono key stack
  follows every key in EVERY play mode; All Notes Off / Reset clear it and
  the arp keys; arp on takes the held keys, arp off gives them voices back.
- Sustain pedal CC 64 (>= 64 down): released keys held (arp keys too)
  until pedal up; CC 120 / 123 clear held keys. Not measured.
- LFO: global, free-running from instance creation; types 0 saw↓ 1 tri
  (-1 at 0) 2 square (+ first) 3 S&H 4 smooth 5 sine; Hz = 2^(s/12.0367)/12 (`measure_lfo_speed.py`, 0.02 %);
  dests 1 osc2 pitch 2 osc1+2 pitch 3 cutoff 4 amp 5 pw 6 FM 7 pan.
  Tempo sync: 30 steps, step = floor(s·30/128), cycle = `Lfo::kSyncBeats`
  16 bars (s 0) .. 1/64T (127) = Synth1's display list; NO host-beat phase
  lock (synced LFOs free-run, the arp starts at the key press).
  Depths (key-synced slow square probes): pitch = bipolar table
  (kLfoPitchCents, 6000 ct at 127); cutoff / amp / pan UNIPOLAR, u =
  (lfo+1)/2: cutoff += (125 - cutoff)·depth/127·u; amp gain = 1 -
  depth/127·(1-u); pan q = lfo·(1-(1-depth/127)^3), gain toward side
  1+|q|/2, away 1-|q|. PW (time-domain duty per cycle): duty w moves toward
  1 (lfo > 0) / 0 (lfo < 0) by depth/127·|lfo| of the room left, never
  wraps. FM: knob += (127 - knob)·depth/127·u, fractional knob, beta
  interpolated (probe saturates above knob ~100).
  BOTH LFOs ON ONE DEST (`measure_lfo_sum.py`): pitch = sum of cents;
  cutoff / FM / pw / pan = the law on the depth-weighted SUM (Σ d·u for
  cutoff / FM, Σ d·lfo for pw / pan; pan unclamped, pw clamps); amp =
  PRODUCT of the per-LFO gains.
- Phase knobs: osc phase (91) 0 = FREE: a voice SLOT's oscillators are
  never reset, they carry on from the slot's last note (frozen while idle)
  from per-slot values set at instance creation (`measure_slot_phase.py` →
  `kSlotOsc1Phase` / `kSlotOsc2Phase`, 32 slots; slots 0..7 osc1 =
  kPhaseDeg; detune copies `kSlotCopyPhase`). > 0 = osc1
  starts at 0, osc2 at (v-1)/126·180°, detune copy i at
  kCopyPhaseDeg[i]·(v-1)/126 (Voice.hpp); a MONO RETRIGGER restarts them
  too. Unison phase (92, osc phase > 0 only): the k-th voice started starts
  kPhaseDeg[k]·v/127 later.
- Mod env amount m = (amt-64)/63 above 64, /64 below. Pitch = ±60
  semis·m·env. PW = the LFO's room-left law with m·env. FM = room-left in
  FM-knob units with m·g: g = env during the attack, during the DECAY g = 1
  + ln(env)/ln(1e4) (FM offset falls LINEARLY to 0 at 9.2 taus).
- Unison (`check_unison.py`: every knob + interactions vs the original,
  nulls ≤ -20 dB where phases are deterministic): a note takes min(voices,
  polyphony) voices (round robin) but never steals from a note started in
  the same 16-sample sub-block (a chord over the polyphony keeps its FIRST
  notes, the rest of a stack is dropped); a voice's PLACE p is FIXED by its slot,
  p = slot % voices (a stack may hold a place twice): detune t·D (t =
  2p/(N-1) - 1, D table), pan spread t·(v-64)/64 (below 64 the LOWEST
  voice goes RIGHT), odd p + (pitch-24) semis; no level compensation. The
  stack voices share osc phases only through the knobs above (osc phase 0:
  each slot's own phases; coherent copies were +12 dB and phasing). Each
  stack voice glides from its own last pitch (PORTAMENTO).
- Pan: patch pan q = (v-64)/64 below the centre, /63 above; balance gains
  (centre 1/1, hard side 1/0); patch pan × unison spread gains MULTIPLY.
- Delay: spread = one side later by 100 ms·10^((|v-64|-63)/21) (0 at 64);
  delay tone (`measure_delay_tone.py`, `kDelayToneHz`): a bilinear one-pole
  in the echo path, 64 = none, < 64 LP 200 Hz·110^(t/63) (22 kHz at 63),
  > 64 HP 10 Hz .. 8 kHz.
- Arp gate 0 = silent.
- Chain order (`measure_fx_order.py`): voices → effect → EQ → delay →
  chorus.
- EQ (`check_eq.py`: every tone / freq / level / Q case within 0.06 dB):
  TONE (`measure_eq_tone.py`, `kEqToneHz`) = one bilinear one-pole, no
  prewarp, ALWAYS on: ≤ 64 LP 200 Hz·110^(t/64) (64 = 22 kHz, the output
  lowpass), > 64 HP 11 Hz .. 7.2 kHz with no lowpass left (tone 65 is ~4
  dB brighter at 16 kHz than 64). PEAK (`measure_eq.py`): f0 =
  50·320^(freq/127), (level−64)·50/127 dB, analog prototype Q
  3.18·2^((q−64)/38.16) (cut = inverse of the boost), poles AND zeros by
  impulse invariance, gain set at f0 (a boost near the top loses up to 3
  dB at DC).
- CHORUS (`measure_chorus.py`): per-channel lines, voice delay = base·(1 +
  D·sin(ωt − θ)), D = (100^(depth/127) − 1)/99, one sine LFO free-running
  from creation, 2.94 Hz·2^((rate−64)/8.89), rate 0 = 0.01 Hz; types 1–3
  L→L / R→R (R θ 0° type 1, 90° types 2 = 3), type 4 L→L 0°, R→L 90°, L→R
  180°, R→R 270°; comb feedback 0.99·(fb−64)/64; wet = level/127, dry
  unity.
- EFFECT SECTION (`measure_effect.py`, `measure_effect_time.py`,
  `reference/meta/effect.json`; laws in the EffectUnit comment):
  distortions = drive table → curve → RBJ HP → RBJ LP 400 Hz·40^(ctl2/127)
  Q3 → gain (level+2)/129, no dry (a.d.1 = fitted asymmetric tanh in a 69
  Hz negative-feedback loop); deci = hold ctl1+1 samples, floor quantiser,
  14 kHz one-pole; r.m. = sine 8000^(ctl1/127) Hz; comp = one-pole |x|
  detector + soft-knee leveller; phasers = 2/4/8/12 allpasses, LEVEL =
  FEEDBACK (0.99·(lv−64)/64), ctl1 = sweep depth, ctl2 = rate, a bouncing
  log-frequency ramp around 1271 Hz (starts at 254.6 Hz).

## Measurement methods (reuse them)

- Reference = the original AU via `build/s1ref/s1ref` (x86_64, Rosetta).
  Simultaneous events keep the job's order (stable sort since 2026-11-03;
  older corpus renders may have chord notes / offs-vs-ons reordered).
  ONE PROCESS PER RENDER (`s1.render_many` does it, parallel): a 2nd
  instance in a process starts with other osc phases / PRNG; the 1st is
  bit-exact repeatable. The 0.25 s pre-roll counts (LFOs free-run in it).
  A fresh Synth1 instance loads program 001 of bankfolder0 (its
  `jp.daichi.synth1` prefs; scripts back up / restore them).
- Python API (`tools/s1ref/s1.py`): `s1.patch(p0=.., p19=..)` = neutral DRY
  patch (osc1 saw, LP12 open, no LFO/fx) + overrides; `render_many(specs,
  ours=False|True)` (ours = s2render), `tone_amp`, `harmonics`, `key_hz`.
  Helpers: `envelope.py`, `pitch.py`, `instfreq.py`, `cutoff_probe.py`
  (effective cutoff in LP12 knob units; calibrate it with the SAME timing
  on the SAME engine), `filtermodels.py`, `fit_*.py`.
- IDENTICAL-NOISE TRICK: osc2 noise is the same sequence in every fresh
  process (ours too), so H(f) = Pxy/Pxx against a flat reference render (HP12 cut 0)
  gives exact complex transfer functions (filters, EQ, delay tone, ...).
  Pulse pw 0 is NOT silence (narrow pulse, it excites LPDL
  self-oscillation): silence osc1 with mix 127 instead.
- Level tricks: lower an oscillator with mix.
- Old manuals: EN https://daichilab.sakura.ne.jp/softsynth/synmanu/readmeeng.html,
  JA (more complete, Shift-JIS) .../synmanu/readme.html; the unofficial
  v1.12 manual (Z. Nikolic 2011) has the version history + per-version
  param table (the lead for the legacy conversion).
- Native value ranges and the AU normalized mapping: reference/meta/
  nativemap.txt; state chunk word layout: tools/s1ref/README.md.
- Reference corpus (`reference/renders`, download in README): regenerate
  with `tools/s1ref/corpus.py` while Rosetta exists; pack with
  `tools/s1ref/pack_reference.sh`. The presets group is anonymized
  (`patch0001`…).

## Status and open items

- Preset-wide diff (`compare.py presets`, 416 renders): level |mean| 1.00
  dB, spec 2.40 dB, env 3.01 dB; `compare.py filter` 0.87 / 2.05 / 2.83.
- Approximations marked `TODO(measure)` in code: a.d.1 exact structure,
  arp random sequence (+ S&H / smooth LFO: not the original's PRNG), LPDL
  resonance frequency near the top cutoffs.
- Random sequences (arp random, S&H / smooth LFO): not identified. Leads:
  S&H read through LFO -> pitch is quantized by PitchMod (useless), through
  LFO -> amp it sits on a 1/1024 grid; the two destinations gave
  DIFFERENT sequences from fresh processes (unexplained); not mac rand(),
  not common 32-bit LCGs, not windows of the noise LFSR. Presets using
  them (patch0368: random arp) move in the scores whenever our RNG draw
  order changes.
- Portamento: glides of 2+ octaves land ~30 ms earlier than the
  original's (the last steps; mid-glide matches). Decay knobs > 88 run
  ~0.5-1 % fast (a release then ends one 256-sample block early).
- Worst presets: patch0106 (+21 dB), patch0025, patch0163 (sync + FM + arp
  + fx combos). Isolated: sync + osc1 FM with osc2 pulse is chaotic (osc2
  resets steer osc1 through the FM): at key 36 FM 32 the original LATCHES
  (osc1 wraps before osc2's pulse ever goes low: a constant), ours does
  not; FM with sync off, and sync without FM, match. Tried: sync on
  negative-going wraps, FM >= 0, pulse FM input x2 / bipolar: no gain.
  patch0010 (LPDL + smooth random LFO). A resonant LP24 pulled shut by a
  strongly negative env with a slow attack stays louder in the original.
  PW: within ~1 / 254 of the original.
